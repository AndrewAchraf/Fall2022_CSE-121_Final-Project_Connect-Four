## Game Description:
Our Connect 4 program is a two-players game in which the players alternately drop their different colored shapes into a grid by choosing the column’s number.  The shapes occupy the next available space within the column.  The objective of the game is to connect-four of one’s own same color shape next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  The two players keep playing until the board is full.  The winner is the player having greater number of connected-fours. 

## User Manual: 
This game consists of a board with horizontal rows and vertical columns. You have access to choose the height and width of the board by editing in the XML file.
One player’s pieces are ‘x’ shaped red colored, the other’s are ‘o’ shaped yellow colored. You can input your colored shape by choosing the column’s number desired and if there is an available space in that column, your shape appears in the bottom or above the last displayed one. In this way the columns start to fill up. 
The objective of the game is to connect-four of one’s own same color shape next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The two players keep playing until the board is full.  The winner is the player having greater number of connected-fours.
